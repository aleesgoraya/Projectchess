## How To Play

We have simplified the interface for you

1.) Press restart to reset the board and play a new game.

2.) Press quit to close the application

This is not your traditional chess game.

The controls are simple.

1.) Use your mouse to click on the piece you want to move.

2.) After selecting your piece, click on the square you want to move to. Simple right!

However, if you make and invalid move(click on a square where a move cannot be made) you lose!


## Extending our Game

To ensure our game follows the path wanted by the community, we decided to make our game easily extendable. To do this, our entire repository is public. This will allow you to copy any files and make the desired modifications. We hope with the help of the community, we can make our chess game a unique and fun spinoff of the classic chess game. 


## Documentation
I, Alees Ahmad Goraya, worked on four classes. The classes are Rook, Knight, Bishop, and View class. I helped my fellow group members and wrote how to play section in readme file.
